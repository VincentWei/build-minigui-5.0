## Current Status

Currently, the latest official release of MiniGUI is version 5.0.6.

Main enhancements of MiniGUI Core and its components are as follow:

- Code tuned for GCC 9.3, so that you can build MiniGUI on Ubuntu 20.04 or
  other Linux distributions which use GCC 9 or later.
- MiniGUI Core:
   + Support for compositing schema under MiniGUI-Processes runtime mode.
     This feature brings the exciting visual effects which are popular
     on modern desktop computers or smart phones to MiniGUI.
   + New main window types/levels. You now can easily create main windows
     in different z-order levels. This enhancement allows us to create
     a special app which acts as screen lock, docker, or launcher.
   + Virtual Window. You now can easily create message threads under all
     runtime modes to exploit the messaging mechanism of MiniGUI in
     non GUI threads - we call them message threads.
   + Enhanced timer support. MiniGUI now manages the timers per message thread.
     Under MiniGUI-Threads runtime mode, you can set up 32 (64 on 64-bit
     architecture) timers for each GUI threads. If you enabled virtual window,
     you can also do this for each message thread.
   + Support for listening a file descriptor as long as the underlying system
     has the `select()` system call for all runtime modes. Now you can call
     `RegisterListenFD()` to register a file descriptor to be listened, and
     handle `MSG_FDEVENT` in your window callback procedure to read/write
     from/to the file descriptor. Before this version, this feature only
     available for MiniGUI-Processes runtime mode.
   + Support for local data of windows. You can now set or retrieve a local data
     which is bound with a string name for a window. This will give you an
     eays-to-use interface to manage various data of a window.
   + Support for hardware cursors under compositing schema. MiniGUI now can
     utilize the hardware cursors if your graphics device support it.
     You can also load a cursor from a PNG file.
   + Support for loading icon from a bitmap file. You can now load an icon
     from a bitmap file such as a PNG file.
   + Unified the message hook functions for all runtime modes. MiniGUI now
     provides the consistent message hook functions for all runtime modes.
   + Use the update regions for cumulative updating the screen. This will
     emilinate the flickers due to the frequently redrawning of controls.
   + Cleaned up a lot of internal symbols (the external functions and
     global variables) in order to avoid name polution.
   + Refactored the code for the following modules: z-order management,
     message queue, event/message handling, and part of graphics abstract
     layer.
   + Enhance the NEWGAL engine `fbcon` (the legacy Linux frame buffer) to
     support compositing schema.
   + Use upstream harfbuzz instead of the modified harfbuzz.
   + Some new APIs.
- mGEff, mGUtils, mGPlus, and mGNCS
   + Tune code for MiniGUI 5.0.0 or later.
   + Cleanup code for bad symbols.
- mGNCS4Touch
   + Tune code to comply with MiniGUI 5.0.0 and mGEff 1.5.0.
   + Tune the speed meter.
   + Enhance `ScrollViewPiece` and `HScrollViewPiece`.
- mg-tests:
   + Add new test programs for MiniGUI 5.0.0 in `5.0/` directory.
   + Add new test programs for compositing schema in `compositor/` directory.
- gvfb:
   + Enhanced to use double buffering to support `SyncUpdate` method.
   + Enhanced to simulate the hardware cursors.

   - MiniGUI Core: Fixed a few minor bugs and made some enhancements.
   - mg-tests: Merge `comm-engines-freertos` from @ehello for FreeRTOS.
   - mg-demos: Merge `softkbd2` from @Iorest to use RIME input engine.

### Known issues

The following known issues all about hardware cursor of DRM engine:

- `drmSetCursor2` and `drmMoveCursor` do not work correctly in DRM engine.
  Libdrm does not provide an interface to set the correct cursor plane, and
  it seems that X held the cursor plane.
- When using a AR24 plane for cursor, `drmSetPlane` seems having a bad
  performance.

### Upcoming features

We plan to develop the following features in the subsequent releases:

- MiniGUI 5.0.x:
   + A comprehensive demonstration program for compositing schema and
     a sample compositor with animations.
   + Clean code of other frequently-used GAL/IAL engines.
- MiniGUI 5.2.x:
   + Support for the `WS_MAXIMIZE` and `WS_MINIMIZE` styles.
   + Tune the input method framework for MiniGUI-Processes runtime mode,
     so that the input method engine can run as a seperate process.

## Building MiniGUI

### Prerequisites

You should run `apt install <package_name>` to install the following packages
on your Ubuntu Linux.

* Building tools:
   * git
   * gcc/g++
   * binutils
   * autoconf/automake
   * libtool
   * make
   * cmake
   * pkg-config
* Dependent libraries:
   * libgtk2.0-dev
   * libjpeg-dev
   * libpng-dev (libpng12-dev on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 instead)
   * libfreetype6-dev
   * libinput-dev
   * libdrm-dev
   * libsqlite3-dev
   * libxml2-dev
   * libssl1.0-dev

You can run the following commands to install all above software packages on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04:

```
$ sudo apt install git g++ binutils autoconf automake libtool make cmake pkg-config
$ sudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev
$ sudo apt install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libfreetype6-dev libharfbuzz-dev
$ sudo apt install libinput-dev libdrm-dev libsqlite3-dev libxml2-dev libssl1.0-dev
```

Note that the `libgtk2.0-dev` packages is used by the virtual frame buffer program `gvfb`.

### Building steps

Please make sure that you can visit GitHub and you can do `sudo` on your Linux box.

1. Clone this repo from GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/VincentWei/build-minigui-5.0.git
$ cd build-minigui-5.0/
```

1. Copy `config.sh` to `myconfig.sh` and edit `myconfig.sh` to match your needs:

```
$ cp config.sh myconfig.sh
```

1. Run `fetch-all.sh` to fetch all source from GitHub:

```
$ ./fetch-all.sh
```

1. Run `build-deps.sh` to build and install gvfb, chipmunk:

```
$ ./build-deps.sh
```

1. Run `build-minigui.sh` to build MiniGUI 5.0:

```
$ ./build-minigui.sh
```

1. Run `mguxdemo`:

```
$ cd cell-phone-ux-demo/
$ ./mginit
```

When there were some updates in the remote repos, you can run `update-all.sh` to
update them. You can run `clean-all.sh` to uninstall and clean them.

Note that you might need to run `ldconfig` to refresh the shared libraries cache
before running `mguxdemo` or other MiniGUI applications.

### Options for build-minigui.sh script

You can pass some options to `build-minigui.sh` script to specify the
compile-time configuration options of MiniGUI Core.

If you did not specify the options, it will use the following default options:

```
procs compositing virtualwindow
```

The options above have the following meanings:

- `procs`: build MiniGUI runs under MiniGUI-Processes runtime mode.
- `compositing`: build MiniGUI to use compositing schema.
- `virtualwindow`: enable virtual window.

The script uses a simple method for the traditional autoconf options:

- The first option always specifies the runtime mode of MiniGUI, you should
  choose one from `procs`, `ths`, or `sa`, which represent MiniGUI-Processes,
  MiniGUI-Threads, and MiniGUI-Standalone runtime modes respectively.
- If you specify an option with a prefix `-`, the feature will be disabled;
  otherwise it is enabled.

For example, if you want to build MiniGUI as standalone runtime mode and
without support for cursor, you can use the following command:

```
$ ./build-minigui.sh sa -cursor
```

### Notes for demos

For the sample of compositing schema, please refer to `mg-tests`:

```
$ cd mg-tests/compositing/
$ ./mginit trackbar
```

![Welcome to MiniGUI 5.0](images/welcome-wallpaper.png)

or

```
$ cd mg-tests/compositing/
$ ./mginit auto
```

![Dynamic Wallpaper](images/dynamic-wallpaper.png)

You can also run other samples, demos, or test programs in `mg-samples`,
`mg-demos` or `mg-tests`.

Note that if you configured MiniGUI as a runtime mode other than
MiniGUI-Processes, please use the following commands to run `mguxdemo`

```
$ cd cell-phone-ux-demo/
$ ./mguxdemo
```

### Commands to build dependencies

The following steps are those ones in `build-deps.sh`. We list them here just
for your information:

1. Make and install `gvfb`:

```
$ cd gvfb
$ cmake .
$ make; sudo make install
$ cd ..
```

1. Make and install `chipmunk` library (DO NOT use the chipmunk-dev package
   which is provided by Ubuntu):

```
$ cd 3rd-party/chipmunk
$ cmake .
$ make; sudo make install
$ cd ../..
```

## Cross Building

MiniGUI 5.0.x can run on lots of CPUs with different architectures, such as
ARM, MIPS and so on, after cross compiled. There is a directory named
`cross-build/`, in which there are some scripts for cross building.

As an example, there is a directory name `arm-r16-linux`, which means: This
directory is for ARM-based SoC `r16`, and the operating system is Linux. In this
directory, there are two scripts for download packages, and build MiniGUI 5.0.x 
for ARM version. You can read the `README.md` in this directory in detail:

  - [arm-r16-linux](cross-build/arm-r16-linux/README.md)

Of course you can build your own directory for your CPU and OS.

## Change Log

Currently, this repo just includes some scripts to build MiniGUI 5.0.x
core, components, and demonstration apps.
